## Project Overview

The Personal Financial Stock Analyzer is a web application that helps users analyze their stock portfolios from stock websites like Fidelity, Robinhood. It uses real-time financial data from Yahoo Finance, generates detailed stock analysis, and provides investment recommendations. The application also includes a chatbot feature that answers finance-related questions using a large language model.

2. **Performance Analysis**: Provides additional analysis on total gain/loss, percentage gain/loss, today's gain/loss, allocation, and cost basis.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the risk category and volatility of each stock.
4. **Chatbot**: An AI assistant that provides answers to finance-related questions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**is the main programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **Yahoo Finance**: For fetching real-time stock data.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive plots.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping recent news articles.
- **Langchain and NVIDIA AI Endpoints**: For integrating the large language model (meta/llama3-8b-instruct) and generating text analysis.
